The folloving syn-thetic reaction schemes and examples are merely illustrative Oct. 27,2011of some methods by which  the compounds of the presentinvention can be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes can be made and will be  sugested to one skilled in the  art having referred to the  disclosure contained in this application. [0072]  The starting materials and the intermediates of thesynthetic  reaction  schemes can  be  isolated  and  purified if  desired using conventional techniques, including but not lim- ited to, fltration, disiation, crystllization, chromatogra-  phy, and the like. Such materials can be characterized using  conventional means, including physical constants and spec-  tral data. [0073] Unless specificall stated otherwise,the experimen-  tal procedures were performed under the following  condi-tions. Evaporation of solvent was carried out using a rotary  evaporator under reduced pressure (600-4000 pascais: 4.5-3O mmi Hg) with a bath temperature ofup to 60 C.Reactions are  typically run under nitrogen atmosphere at ambient tempera-  ture if not otherwise mentioned. Anhydrous solvent such asTHF, DMF, Et,O, DME and Toluene are commercial grade. Reagents are commercial grade and were used without fur- her' purification. Flash chromatography is run on silica gel(230-400 mesh). The course of the reaction was followed by  either thin layer chromatography (TLC) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry and reaction times given are forillustration only.The structure and purity ofall fnal prod- ucts were ascertained by TIC, mass spectrometry, 1H NMR and high-pressure iquid chromatography (HPLC).:Chemical  symbols have their usual meanings. The following abbrevia- tions have also been used: v (volume), w (weight), b.p. (boil-  ingpoint), m.p. (meltingpoint) L(Iiers) mL (miiters).  g (gram(s). mg (miligram(s). mol (moie(s). mmol (mii- mole(s), eq.7(equivalent(s).7Uinless othervise specified, al1variables mentioned below have the meanings as provided  above.[0074]Compounds of the present invention  can be pre- pared according to the following general methods described  in Scheme 1. For example, deprotonation of the benzyl nitrile  II using LiHMDS/HMPA and subsequently addition of an activated benzyl moiety oftype I, wherein X can be bromide or iodide can afford the intermediates IV. The 1ater can beconverted via a palladium catalyzed Suzuki coupling toVII  using the appropriate boronic acid V. Finall, the nitrile VII  can  be  reduced  under  various  conditions  (hydrogenation,CoC1,/NaBH-,. NiCI1-/NaBH-) to afford compound'1. Alter- natively, the benzyl 'nitrile III can  be homologated  to the  biaryl nitrile VIII'via a Suzuki coupling with'VI. Subse-  quently the biaryl can be benzylated as described previously,  to generate the advance intermediate VII. A third possibie  route involves the selective reduction of the nitrile IV usingCoCI1,/NaBH, followed by a protection ofthe resulting amine as a t-butyl carbamate to provide IX. The protected amine IX can  be `converted tothe coresponding *pinacolo  boronate  derivative X using a palladium catalyzed couplingwith pina-col diborane. Finally, Suzuki coupling of the pinacolo bor- onate X with the appropriate aryl1'bromide V, followed by a ]deprotection of the t-butyl carbamate protective group pro- vides I. A fourth route, described in Scheme 1, can also iead  to the advance intermediate IX in a two steps procedure. First,  a Knoevenagel type condensation between the aldehyde Xi  and the benzy1 nitril IIIcan afford the unsaturated anailogXIIwhich can be ultimately reduced under previously described conditions to give IX.",[],[],[]

The agreement was executed on Dec. 4, 2003.The field of the invention is described below.  FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The invention relates to novel renin inhibitors of the general  formula  (I). The  invention  also  concerns  related aspects including processes for the preparation of the com-  pounds,  pharmaceutical  compositions  containing  one  or  more compounds of formula (I) and especially their use as  renin  inhibitors  in cardiovascular events  and renal insuffi-ciency. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] In the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) the biologi- cally active angiotensin II (Ang I) is generated by a two-step mechanism. The highly specific enzyme renin cleaves angio-  tensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I), which  is then further  processed to Ang II by the less specific angiotensin-convert-  ing enzyme (ACE). Ang II is known to work on at least two  receptor subtypes called AT, and AT,. Whereas AT , seems to  transmit most 'of the known functions of Ang II, the role of  AT, isil uknown. [0004]  Modulation of the RAS represents a major advance  in  the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE inhibitors and AT, blockers have been accepted to treat hypertension (Waeber  B. et  al., *The  renin-angiotensin  system: role inexperimental and human hypertension'', in Birkenhager W.  H., Reid J. L. (eds): Hypertension, Amsterdam, Elsevier Sci-  ence Publishing,Co, 1986, 489-519; Weber M. A., 4Am. J. Hypertens. 1992, 5, 247S). In addition, ACE inhibitors are  used  for renal protection  (Rosenberg M. E. et al. Kidney International, 1994, 45, 403; Breyer J.A. et al., Kidney Inter- national. 1994, 45, S156), in the prevention'of congestive heart failure (Vaughan D. E.etal., Cardiovasc. Res., 1994,28, 159; Fouad-Tarazi F.et al.,4Am. J.Med. 1988,84 (Suppl. 3A), 83) and myocardial infarction (Pfeffer M.A. et al. N. Engl. 3. Med. 1992,327, 669). [0005] The rationale to developrenin inhibitors is the speci- icity of renin (Kleinert H. D., Cardiovasc. Drugs, 1995, 9, 645). The only substrate known for renin is angiotensinogen,  which  can  only  be  processed (under physiological condi- tions) by renin. In contrast, ACE can also cleave bradykinin besides'Ang I and can be'by-passed by chymase, a`serine  protease  (Husain  A, J. Hypertens., 1993' 1,'1155).' Tn  patients inhibition of ACE thus leads to bradykinin accumu- 1ation causing cough (5-20%) and potentially life-threatening angioneurotic edema (0.1-0.2%) (Israili Z. H. et al., Annals of  Internal Medicine, 1992, 117,234). Chymase is notinhibited  by ACE inhibitors. Therefore, the formation of Ang II is stillpossible in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. Biockade of  the AT , receptor (e.g. by losartan) on the other hand overex- poses other AT-receptor subtypes (e-.g. AT-) to Ang II, whose concentration is significantly'increased by  the biockade of AT, receptors. In summary, renin inhibitors are expected to  demonstrate  a dfferent  pharmaceutical  profle  than  ACE inhibitors and AT, blockers with regard to`eficacy in block-  ing the RAS and in safety aspects. Oct. 27,2011[0006]I The present invention relates to the identification of  renin inhibitors of a non-peptidic nature and of low molecularweight. Described are orally active renin inhibitors of long duration of action  which are active in  indications  beyondblood pressure regulation where the tissular renin-chymasesystem  may  be  activated  leading  to  pathophysiologically altered local functions  such as renal,  cardiac  and  vascular remodeling, atherosclerosis, and possibly restenosis. So, the  present invention describes these non-peptidic renin inhibi-tors. [0007] The compounds  described in this invention repre-sent a novel structural class of renin inhibitors.  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0008]  The present invention  is directed to certain com-pounds and their use in the inhibition of the renin enzyme, including treatment of conditions  known  to be  associated with the renin system. The invention includes compounds of Formula I:[ooo9] The present invention relates to compounds of the formula (I) (Ar'HNand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein  Ar' is an unsubstituted or substituted aryl ring or an unsub-stituted or substuted 5 or 6-membered heteroaryl ring con-  taining 1 to 2 heteroatoms selected from O, S and N, whereinthe  substituted aryl ring and substituted heteroaryl ring are  substituted with one, two or three substituents independentlyselected from the group consisting of:1)OH,2)cN,[ouo] 3) halogen, 4)N,  5) No, 6)COOH,7)OCF,H, )cr.
